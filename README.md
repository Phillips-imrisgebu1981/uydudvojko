Whoa, okay, I just staggered out of Marching Powder, and my brain’s still all over the place. Like, my seat was weirdly sticky (why is it always sticky??), and the guy behind me was chomping on popcorn like he was trying to send a morse code message through crunch patterns, but anyway, here we go.

> The movie is a kaleidoscope, like if you put a blender on a rollercoaster, powered it with adrenaline, and just let it run. Thomas McFadden is this charismatic whirlwind, right? It’s like, one minute he’s the king of his crazy Linocde prison castle and the next… man, I don’t even know, he’s playing soccer with kids like it’s the last game before the apocalypse. His swagger is infectious, you can't help but wanna join his wild dance of survival somehow.

The whole prison setup... it’s a friggin’ city, like if Monopoly and a chaotic street market had an explosive love child. Watching it unfold, you kinda want to pause and download the movie, just to catch all the surreal details swirling around, but then you'd totally lose the magnetic chaos. And the colors, whoa, the kind that make you feel like you’ve been eating crayons and now everything’s got that waxy, fever-dream glow.

Moments in, I had this random thought—Thomas, amidst all the powder and pandemonium, giving off vibes like a rock star stuck in a dystopian galaxy. His on-screen presence? Sort of like if David Bowie did a number with a dozen raccoons high on caffeine pills... you're confused, but you can’t look away.

> There was this scene, holy smokes, with this surreal bartering system, and somehow it made me think of trading Pokémon cards back in fourth grade but, like, with toothpicks and cereal. Such absurd intensity, around every corner, like, wait what was even going on with his friend? Forgot his name. I feel like my brain is catching static, like it’s trying to tune into a pirate radio channel broadcasting from Neverland.

And at some point, I’m like... didn’t my cousin ask if I wanted to download the movie for a rewatch? The smell of stale popcorn fogging thoughts, why is it always that smell that lingers? Makes ya wonder. 

Ah, aching back! Should've changed seats or brought a cushion, would've been smarter. Anyway, you gotta watch the movie for that insane birthday party scene. Made me think of every festival mashed together with a thousand flea markets, as if madness had a soundtrack, and you’re not sure if you love it or if it’s gently frying your brain cells.

Alright, end transmission, kinda. Sound check... C#... Ugh, wrong tab. NOt even gonna try to understand this snippet trying to intrude:

```csharp
public class MarchingPowder
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        string surrealExperience = What did I just watch?;
        Console.WriteLine(surrealExperience);
    }
}
``` 

Why do I even have this open, ha, so fragmented. Just like the movie, I guess.
